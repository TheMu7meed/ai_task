                    Artificial intelligence (AI), known by some as the industrial revolution (IR), 
                    is going to change not only the way we do things, how we relate to others, 
                    but also what we know about ourselves. This article will first examine what AI is, 
                    discuss its impact on industrial, social, and economic changes on humankind in the 21st century, 
                    and then propose a set of principles for AI bioethics. The IR1.0, the IR of the 18th century, 
                    impelled a huge social change without directly complicating human relationships. Modern AI, 
                    however, has a tremendous impact on how we do things and also the ways we relate to one another. 
                    Facing this challenge, new principles of AI bioethics must be considered and developed to provide 
                    guidelines for the AI technology to observe so that the world will be benefited by the progress of 
                    this new intelligence.
